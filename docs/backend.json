User data is stored in a private collection, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own information. Specifically, the `/users/{userId}` path provides path-based ownership, making security rules straightforward and efficient. The absence of collaborative data at this stage simplifies the structure, focusing on core user management. This design uses a single collection for users. This structure avoids `get()` calls in rules, enabling atomic operations and easier debugging. Rules will be more robust and maintainable."
